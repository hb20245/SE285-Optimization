# This directory contains all the outputs we will obtain from our simulation; our primary focus will be on the bonds.reax for now

The meaning of the column header abbreviations is as follows:

id = atom id; numerical identifier for each atom

type = atom type; hydrogen type 1; carbon   type 2; oxygen   type 3

nb = number of bonds *We can place one of our constraints as nb = 3; charectaristic of sp2

id_1 = atom id of first bond

id_nb = atom id of Nth bond

mol = molecule id

bo_1 = bond order of first bond

bo_nb = bond order of Nth bond

abo = atom bond order (sum of all bonds)

nlp = number of lone pairs

q = atomic charge

## Example line indicating sp2
2051 2 3 2047 2053 2054 0 1.029 0.958 1.575 3.563 0.000 -0.001 
*2051 is a carbon atom (type2) bonded to 3 other atoms where bond orders = [1.03, 0.96, 1.58] (sp2 carbon has 2 single bonds and one double bond; we have one slightly stronger bond in this ensemble, possibly indicating sp2)
*Overall bond order is 3.563 which is another indicator we are likely looking at sp2;
