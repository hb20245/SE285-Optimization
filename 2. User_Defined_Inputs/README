# These will be the two main input files that we will be working with for the project

## in.run ##
  # I will type additional notes within the in.run file to help with understanding; feel free to ask any questions! 
  # The software I use to run molecular dynamics is called LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator)
  # in.run is the LAMMPS input file, which defines our system, what we want to simulate, and what thermodynamic data we want to record from our simulation
  # This file is where we will call on the files in our 'ground truth inputs'
